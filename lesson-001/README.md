# My First Website - Lesson 1
 
## Minimal HTML
--- 
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <body></body>
    </html>

## Now I have added a head tag. Here we can include the page title
---

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>

        <head>
            <title>Webpage Title</title>
        </head>

        <body></body>

    </html>

## Between the body tags we place all the content that we want to show in the browser. Think of an **h tag (heading)** and a **p tag (text)**
---

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>

        <head>
            <title>Webpage Title</title>
        </head>

        <body>


            <h1>This is my First Website</h1>

            <p>I really enjoy creating a website</p>
            
        </body>

    </html>

## We also add a header and a footer to our page. The **main** tag specifies the main content of a document.

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>

        <head>
            <title>Webpage Title</title>
        </head>

        <body>

            <header></header>

            <main>

                <h1>This is my First Website</h1>

                <p>I really enjoy creating a website</p>

            </main>

            <footer></footer>
            
        </body>

    </html>
